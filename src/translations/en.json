  "intro": "I think like a developer, design like a user, and solve like someone who sees beyond the bug.\n\nEvery line of code I write has intention. I learn what the project needs and apply it right when it matters. I don‚Äôt collect tools. I transform.\n\nI‚Äôm in a polishing phase, yes. But I already bring value, structure, and direction. I‚Äôm not a finished product. I‚Äôm evolution with character.\n\nAnd what I carry inside... that can‚Äôt be taught.",

  "motivacionTexto": "I never imagined I‚Äôd end up in the world of web development.\n\nFor years, I moved between patients, paperwork, logistics and people. I did a bit of everything: caring, organizing, solving. I liked making things work for others.\n\nBut something inside me asked for more. More creativity, more challenge, more future.\n\nI started exploring what else was out there‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt know yet, but that could connect with who I already am and let me be even more of it.\n\nI discovered that programming wasn‚Äôt just writing code. It was solving problems, designing experiences, improving systems and understanding needs.\n\nI didn‚Äôt leave behind who I was. I transformed it.\n\nToday I don‚Äôt care for patients, but I still listen. I don‚Äôt manage documents, but I organize logic. I don‚Äôt translate languages, but I turn ideas into interfaces.\n\nCode also cares, organizes and solves. But it also builds. And for someone like me, that was a revolution.\n\nThis is not a career change. It‚Äôs evolution with purpose.\n\nSince then, I haven‚Äôt stopped. Not just learning, but imagining. Because now I finally know I can create what I used to just manage.",
