  "intro": "I think like a developer, design like a user, and solve problems like someone who sees beyond the bug.\n\nEvery line of code I write has purpose. I learn exactly what the project needs and apply it when it truly matters. I don‚Äôt collect tools - I turn them into impact.\n\nI‚Äôm still being polished, yes - but I already bring value, clarity, and direction. I‚Äôm not the final product. I‚Äôm evolution in motion.\n\nAnd what I carry inside‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be taught.",

  "motivacionTexto": "I never imagined I‚Äôd end up in the world of web development.\n\nFor years, I moved between patients, paperwork, logistics, and people. I did a bit of everything: I cared, I organized, I solved problems. I liked making things work for others.\n\nBut something inside me was asking for more. More creativity, more challenge, more future.\n\nI started exploring what else was out there that I didn‚Äôt know yet‚Ä¶ but that connected with who I already was, and where I could be even more myself.\n\nI discovered programming wasn‚Äôt just writing code ‚Äî it was solving problems, designing experiences, improving systems, and understanding needs.\n\nI didn‚Äôt leave who I was behind. I transformed it.\n\nToday, I don‚Äôt treat patients, but I still listen. I don‚Äôt handle paperwork, but I organize logic. I don‚Äôt translate languages, but I turn ideas into interfaces.\n\nCode also cares, organizes, and solves. But it also builds. And for someone like me, that was a revelation.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a change in career. It‚Äôs evolution with purpose.\n\nSince then, I haven‚Äôt stopped. Not just learning, but imagining. Because now I know I can create what I used to only manage.",
